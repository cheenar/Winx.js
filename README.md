* Lightweight, JavaScript Runtime
* Built on battle-tested (presumably!) V8 JavaScript Engine
* Building towards JNI support

## Configuration

You can define a `Winx.toml` file in the same directory as executing the `winx` binary. You are able 
to configure any [V8 Flag](./V8_FLAGS.md) by default. 

```toml
[v8]
max-heap-size = 2048
jitless = true
gc-experiment-less-compaction = true
expose-wasm = false

[winx]
polyfills_file = "./src/polyfills/Winx.js"
```

### [winx] Config

* `polyfills_file` - Location to load the "polyfills" to support features such as console.log.
